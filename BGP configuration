Creating BGP process:

```
Router bgp <AS>
neighbor <peer ip> remote-as <Local ASN #>
neighbor <peer ip> soft-reconfiguration inbound  
network <whole network ip of local> mask <255.255.255.0>
```


	soft-reconfiguration inbound  (configures seperate cache that stores incoming advertisements from ISP prior to filtering)


Create BGP process:
		Router(config)# router bgp <65501>

	Add networks to BGP table:
		Router(config-router)# network <10.1.2.0> mask <255.255.255.0>
		Router(config-router)#network <10.0.0.0> mask <255.0.0.0>


Add peers to BGP:

```
neighbor <10.1.2.78> remote-as <65505>
neighbor <10.3.5.2> remote-as <65501>
```

	Redistribute OSPF into BGP
		Router(config-router)# redistribute ospf <175> (OSPF PID)

!
!rtrIL BGP Configs
!
router bgp 1xx   (This number is assigned to you)
neighbor 63.2.xx.17 remote-as 7922  (ISP's IP)
neighbor 63.2.xx.17 soft-reconfiguration inbound  (configures seperate cache that stores incoming advertisements from ISP prior to filtering)
network 10.2.xx.0 mask 255.255.255.0


Null route (how to ensure route is in the routing table)

```
ip route 10.2.xx.0 255.255.255.0 null0
```

Verification

show ip bgp neighbor [x.x.x.x] received-routes

must have "soft-reconfiguration inbound" set for peer
		this command stores all unfiltered routes from neighbor in seperate database

To view routes being sent to neighbor
		show ip bgp neighbor [x.x.x.x] advertised-routes
	
show ip bgp         *important*
show ip bgp neighbors
show ip bgp summary
show run | sec bgp
show ip bgp neighbor <neighbor ip> advertised-routes
show ip bgp neighbor <neighbor ip> received-routes*** (needs soft reconfigured route enabled)
clear ip bgp * soft  (basically unplugging and plugging back in. try not to use.)
